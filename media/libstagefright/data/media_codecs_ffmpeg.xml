<!-- Stub media_codecs_ffmpeg.xml to be included by devices' media_codecs.xml

     This file is normally provided by external/stagefright-plugins, but
     Halium doesn't build this library. It doesn't make much sense to build
     it because we already have media frameworks available in the host
     environment. However, many devices have its media_codecs.xml include
     this file. Without this file, the whole codec listing process fails.
     Thus, to avoid fixing potentially tens of device trees, this file is
     provided.
